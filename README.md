While most of the code is aimed to be applicable to general robust optimization problems,
some of the solvers only implement the special cases needed for the numerical experiments yet.
We are happy to collaborate on making this a more general-purpose library.

## Prerequisites

- C++20 or newer is required for compiling the project.
- The project has been tested on Gurobi 9.5. It may be compatible with other versions, with minor modifications to `CMakeLists.txt`.
- Ensure the environment variable `GUROBI_HOME` is set to point to your Gurobi installation directory.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tumBAIS/piecewise-affine-ARO.git
   cd piecewise-affine-ARO
   ```

2. **Set Up Gurobi Environment Variable**

   Set the `GUROBI_HOME` environment variable to point to your Gurobi installation directory.
   Replace `/path/to/gurobi` with the actual path to your Gurobi installation:

    ```bash
   export GUROBI_HOME=/path/to/gurobi
   ```

3. **Create a Build Directory**
   It's a good practice to create a separate build directory:
    ```bash
   mkdir build
    cd build
   ```

4. **Configure the Project with CMake**

   Run CMake from the build directory to configure the project:

    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```

5. **Compile the Project**

   Compile the project using the makefile generated by CMake:

    ```bash
    make
    ```

## Usage

The repository is structured in three parts:
1. `models` contains a relatively general framework to model robust optimization and second-order cone problems.
2. `solver` implements all solvers compared in the numerical experiments of the paper.
3. `tests` implements the numeric test instances presented in the paper.
